Project, created for my employer, to download and manipulate sales & analytic report files for Data Warehouse ingestion. The scripts currently download over 120 files a week.

There are different scripts for each different report type. All of these scripts are run from control_script.py. Functions are held in functions.py and configuration items (such as logins, target and source files and folders) are in config.xlsx.

For privacy reasons I have amended the scripts to remove any web element details.
